# List Editing

See the original article [Prepend, Append... What?](www.confusing-acronym.com/prepend-append-what/)

You can use this script to try out different list operations if you're interested.
For instance you could edit the list operations in the zoo files, then run

```
python print-relationship-targets.py ./zoo/root.usda
```

It should also work on your own files and prims.


```
python print-relationship-targets.py /path/to/file /PrimPath/In/Stage
```
